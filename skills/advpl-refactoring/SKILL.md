description: Use when the user asks to refactor, clean up, or restructure existing ADVPL/TLPP code on TOTVS Protheus without changing its behavior -- extracting long functions (>100 lines), simplifying deeply nested conditionals, removing dead code, improving variable naming (Hungarian notation), eliminating duplicated logic, or reducing functions with too many parameters. Also triggers on Portuguese phrasing like "refatorar rotina", "melhorar esse fonte", "extrair funcao", "remover codigo morto", "simplificar condicional", "reduzir complexidade", or "God function" complaints.

# ADVPL/TLPP Refactoring

This skill defines safe refactoring patterns (RF-001 through RF-006) for improving ADVPL/TLPP code structure without altering behavior: extract function, simplify conditionals with guard clauses, remove dead code, improve naming to Hungarian notation, eliminate duplication, and reduce function parameter count. It also defines the mandatory process -- analyze, prioritize, present a before/after plan, wait for user approval, apply one change at a time, verify -- and hard safety rules (never change business logic, never rename externally-used symbols without a caller check).

Activate this skill when the user wants existing, working code restructured for readability or maintainability: long functions, deep nesting, unclear names, copy-pasted blocks, or functions with excessive parameters. It does not cover fixing bugs or errors (see `advpl-debugging`), generating brand-new functionality (see `advpl-code-generation`), a formal quality/security audit (see `advpl-code-review`), or converting procedural `.prw` to object-oriented `.tlpp` (see `advpl-to-tlpp-migration`, which is a structural paradigm change rather than a behavior-preserving cleanup).
