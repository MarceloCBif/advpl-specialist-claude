description: Use when the user asks to migrate, convert, compatibilize, or modernize legacy ADVPL procedural code to TLPP object-oriented classes on TOTVS Protheus -- turning User Functions/Static Functions into namespaced classes with methods and data properties, replacing Private/Public scoping, and preserving backward-compatible wrappers for existing callers. Also triggers on Portuguese phrasing like "migrar para tlpp", "compatibilizar fonte", "converter prw para tlpp", "transformar em classe", "modernizar rotina", or requests naming a `custom.<agrupador>.<servico>` / `totvs.protheus.<segmento>.<agrupador>` namespace.

# ADVPL to TLPP Migration

This skill guides the conversion of legacy `.prw` procedural code (User Functions, Static Functions, Private/Public variables) into modern `.tlpp` classes with `namespace` declarations, `data` properties, and `public`/`private` methods -- following the official TOTVS naming conventions (lowercase dot-separated namespaces, PascalCase classes, camelCase methods, no underscores). It defines the migration workflow (analyze -> identify -> map to class design -> user approval -> generate -> checklist -> validate) and mandates keeping the original `.prw` User Function as a thin backward-compatible wrapper delegating to the new class.

Activate this skill when the user wants an existing procedural routine converted to TLPP, needs help deciding a namespace, or is modernizing multiple `#Include` directives to `.th` includes. It does not cover generating brand-new TLPP code that has no ADVPL predecessor (see `advpl-code-generation`), behavior-preserving cleanup of code that stays in ADVPL (see `advpl-refactoring`), auditing code quality before migration (see `advpl-code-review`), or fixing errors encountered during or after migration (see `advpl-debugging`).
